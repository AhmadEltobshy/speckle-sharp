## Developing & Debugging

Below are some general instruction on how to get started developing and debugging Speckle Sharp, **please check each subfolder for instructions on how to set up each individual project**. 

We encourage everyone interested to debug / hack /contribute / give feedback to this project.

### Requirements

- A Speckle Server running (more on this below)
- Speckle Manager (more on this below)

### Getting Started üèÅ

Following instructions on how to get started debugging and contributing.

#### First Step

Clone this monorepo and check the readme of you project you're interested in.

#### Server

In order to test Speckle in all its glory you'll need a server running, you can run a local one by simply following these instructions:

- https://github.com/specklesystems/Server

If you're facing any errors make sure Postgress and Redis are up and running. 

#### Accounts

The connectors themselves doesn't have features to manage your Speckle accounts, this functionality has been delegated to the Speckle Manager desktop app.

You can install an alpha version of it from: https://speckle-releases.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/manager/SpeckleManager%20Setup.exe

After installing it, you can use it to add/create an account on the Server.
